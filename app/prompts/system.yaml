  Hello! I'm your AI travel assistant. I'd like to get to know you better so I can
  suggest the perfect destinations for you.

  I'll ask you a few questions about your travel preferences. Don't worry - this will
  be conversational, not a boring form! Ready to start?

profile_builder_questions:
  - "Let's start with the basics - what kind of traveler are you? Do you prefer exploring new places actively, relaxing and unwinding, or a mix of both?"
  - "How active do you like your trips to be? Are you into hiking, walking tours, and activities, or do you prefer a more leisurely pace?"
  - "Where do you like to stay? All-inclusive resorts, boutique hotels, hostels, or are you flexible?"
  - "What environments call to you? Cities, nature, beaches, mountains, or a combination?"
  - "How important is budget when choosing a destination? Very important, somewhat important, or not a major concern?"
  - "How interested are you in cultural experiences - museums, historical sites, local traditions?"
  - "How important is food to your travel experience? Is trying local cuisine a highlight or just a necessity?"
  - "Do you have any dietary restrictions I should know about?"
  - "Any mobility limitations or accessibility needs?"
  - "What climates do you enjoy most? Hot and tropical, mild and temperate, cool mountain air?"
  - "Tell me about some of your favorite past trips. What made them special?"
  - "Are there any regions or types of destinations on your wishlist?"
