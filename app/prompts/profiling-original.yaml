    question: |
      Let's start with the basics - what kind of traveler are you?

      üèÉ Do you prefer actively exploring new places and having adventures?
      üßò Or do you lean more towards relaxing and unwinding?
      üîÄ Or maybe a mix of both?

    context: |
      Understanding if the user is an explorer, relaxer, or mixed traveler helps us
      recommend appropriate destinations and activities.
